Emcey-Book-List
Emcey-Book-List is an online library application built using Vite.js, React, and MongoDB. Users can create their own accounts, manage their book lists, and explore a collection of books. Additionally, there is an admin panel that allows administrators to manage users, books, and perform administrative tasks.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their own book lists.
Book Management: Users can add, edit, and delete books from their lists.
Admin Panel: Administrators have access to an admin panel for managing users and books.
GraphQL API: The backend uses GraphQL for querying and manipulating data.
